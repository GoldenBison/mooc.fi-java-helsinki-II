# mooc.fi-java-helsinki-II
Solutions to Part II of the University of Helsinki's massive open online course on object-oriented programming with Java, located at: http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-2/
<hr>

The course material is identical to that of the University of Helsinki's CS1 courses. As a first year computer science student, I am completing this online course to supplement my studies at university and to learn/enhance my understanding of various programming concepts in a language different to that taught in my university classes (i.e. C).
